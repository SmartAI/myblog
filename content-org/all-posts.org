The author first explains what dopamine is. Actually, dopamine isn't the substance that causes pleasure itself, but rather one that triggers the impulse or craving to satisfy a desire. Pleasure itself is derived from other chemicals, unrelated to dopamine.

Dopamine is easily hijacked, for example, by drugs. Drugs can completely rewire the brain's circuitry. The brain typically has two circuits: one is the desire circuit, which primarily generates the feeling of 'wanting,' driving the pursuit of things that feel good or satisfy basic needs (food, water, social connection, etc.). It also helps remember the rewards associated with certain actions, encouraging their repetition. Dopamine plays a crucial role in this circuit. The other is the control circuit, responsible for higher-level thinking like planning, decision-making, and impulse control. It acts as the brain's brakes and steering wheel. These two circuits work in opposition to each other. Substances like drugs completely destroy the control circuit while strengthening the desire circuit. Therefore, drugs must absolutely be avoided, as they cause irreversible brain damage.

Furthermore, life contains many subtle things that act similarly to drugs, such as gambling and pornography, and even things like smoking, alcohol, and tea [caffeine]. Also, the various forms of social media, short videos, and games emerging today fall into this category. These can all hijack human attention and become addictive.

Human time is limited, and focus is an extremely valuable resource. If one lacks control over their own focus and is constantly stimulated by external things, it's like being numb or paralyzed – how tragic. In fact, the deprivation of focus can lead to a series of irreversible effects, such as irritability, anxiety, lack of empathy, inability to think deeply, and an aversion to using written language.

Li Xiaolai [or "The author"] mentioned some points related to parenting that I found quite insightful and agree with. For example, regarding television. He believes TV affects attention and should be avoided as much as possible, especially for infants and toddlers. If watching TV is unavoidable, documentaries are a better option, but it should be watched attentively, demanding the same kind of quiet focus as one would have in a movie theater. Furthermore, regarding how to solve the problem of children being constantly engrossed in screens, many suggestions have been offered, such as setting time limits, using rewards, etc. In the author's view, the fundamental solution is to occupy that attention time with other activities. A very simple method is outdoor activity. The longer the outdoor activity time, the better, especially for younger children. Exercise can solve almost anything; physical strength is the foundation of mental capacity. The barrier to learning isn't talent or IQ, but physical health and longevity. It's best to help children develop a daily exercise habit before age ten, such as running. Another point is to teach children programming, using text (code) to create.

Later, the author delves deeper into the source of irresistible temptations, arguing that it lies in one's values. This was the first time I had heard this perspective. Values reflect a person's self-judgment regarding things; put simply, it's about comparison or prioritization. For example, how do you rank health versus work? There's also the strength of this ranking – whether these so-called values are stable. Some people have never really compared them, while others are vague when they do. This involves the use of the control circuit.

There are things in life that can strengthen this circuit, such as fear. For instance, doctors in hospitals, seeing so many patients sick for various reasons every day, implicitly strengthen this circuit. Reading books is another way; reading allows one to rapidly absorb the author's distilled knowledge, accumulated through long periods of thought.

Regarding the importance and skillful use of written language, I strongly agree. Too many people in life have lost the ability to use written language effectively, especially for output (writing). Writing output is actually an excellent process for self-reflection and consolidating thoughts. Even mathematics relies heavily on language skills. If one's language skills are poor, proficiency in many areas can be hindered. For example, I believe language study can train one's logical thinking. Reflecting on my own experience, language classes in school involved no real thinking training; essay writing was just about empty, grandiose clichés. Normally, my written output was limited to weekly reports, lacking systematic writing practice. After starting my Master's degree again, I finally recognized my problem: my significant gap in writing ability actually reflects issues with my way of thinking. In the future, especially with the rise of AI, the mastery of natural language will become even more crucial.

One application of using text is for 'brainwashing' oneself, for example, through retelling or repetition. This is very interesting because the brain tends to believe results it produces itself more than those absorbed from others (e.g., seen or heard). So, one method of influencing oneself is to constantly repeat content to oneself. This tricks the brain into thinking the content originated internally. Therefore, repeating things sufficiently to oneself over a short period is a truly effective way—or at least one effective way—to change oneself. For example, one can frequently retell events from life: movies watched, knowledge learned, etc.

Then, returning to a fundamental question: since time (or attention) is a finite, non-renewable resource, where should I invest it? Generally, our daily routine consists of sleep, exercise, relaxation, learning, work, and other activities. But many people, including myself, get the priorities wrong. Sleep, exercise, and relaxation are arguably more important than work and learning. A simple example: one night of poor sleep can hinder proper work performance for the next two or three days. When it's time to rest, don't let other things interfere, especially electronic devices. Spacing out, taking a bath, sunbathing, walking, singing, and dancing are all good ways to relax.

Regarding work and learning, a good suggestion is to treat work as learning, adopting a mindset of working for oneself. When making decisions, one must consider the cost to one's focus, which can sometimes be enormous. Focus is a more valuable resource than talent, IQ, cleverness, or opportunities.

** DONE My blogging workflow: based on Emacs               :blog:emacs:hugo:

During the holiday at home these past few days, I decided to pick up =Emacs= again. So, I went ahead and completely reconfigured my =Emacs= setup, covering both my usual writing ( =Org= , =LaTeX= , etc.) and programming (mainly =C++= ). After finishing this setup tinkering, I remembered I had an unused domain name I wanted to utilize, so I decided to build this blog. Actually, I had been considering setting up a blog for a while but always gave up, mainly due to a lack of motivation for writing. Over the weekend, on the way to =Parksvill= , I read Li Xiaolai's book [[id:the-truth-of-attention]["The Truth of Attention"]], which made me feel it's necessary to strengthen my habit of written output.
#+hugo: more

This blog post briefly documents how I set up this workflow, mainly involving several parts: configuration in =Emacs= , usage of =hugo= and its templates, and using =GitHub Pages= .

I am using the combination of Emacs + Hugo + Github Pages. Since I'm quite used to writing Org documents, after writing my blog posts in Org within Emacs, I directly use =ox-hugo= to export them to Markdown, and then push them to GitHub for serving. Here, I primarily referred to the =ox-hugo= [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][official documentation]].
The configuration in =Emacs= is mainly to handle the export from Org files to Markdown files. I adopted the 'One post per Org subtree' approach, where each article is a second-level heading. Each first-level heading represents a separate section. There isn't much to say about this part; just configure and organize your Org documents according to the official documentation. One thing to pay special attention to is that the top of the Org file needs the =hugo_base_dir= configured, and each post needs its export filename configured via =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= . Once configured, you can write your blog posts just like you normally write Org documents. Theoretically, all formats supported by Org can be used directly, but be aware that some formats might produce unexpected behavior when exporting to Markdown. When you need to export, you can use the Emacs shortcut =C-c C-e H H= to export to a Markdown document.

To use Hugo to generate the static site, you can install the environment locally and preview the generated web pages. For Hugo installation, refer to the official documentation. Here I recommend a very simple theme, [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearblog/][hugo-bear]]; configure it according to its documentation. After configuration, run =hugo server= locally to ensure you can successfully preview the website.

To serve the website online, there are many options. There are paid and free solutions, such as =cloudflare= or =GitHub Pages= . I personally use =GitHub Pages= . =GitHub Pages= is essentially a service for serving static files. Therefore, before that, you still need to use Hugo to generate the static files from the Markdown files. Since =GitHub= has the =Action= feature, it's very convenient to automatically generate these static files after we =Push= the code to the =remote= . As for configuring the =Action= , I directly asked =ChatGPT= , and the provided script can be used directly. Save this script to the =.github/workflows/deploy.yml= file in your blog's code repository.

#+begin_src yaml
  name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch (e.g., main)
  push:
    branches:
      - main  

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:

  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

# Default to bash
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      HUGO_VERSION: 0.146.6 
    steps:
      - name: Install Hugo CLI
        run: |
          wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \
          && sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 
        with:
          submodules: recursive 
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Build with Hugo
        env:
          # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules
          HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
          HUGO_ENV: production
        run: |
          hugo \
            --gc \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/" 
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 # Upload the built html files
        with:
          path: ./public

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build # 
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4 # 
#+end_src

Additionally, you need to go into the repository's =setting= to enable Pages using =Actions=. You can also configure your custom domain there. Refer to this screenshot:
[[file:~/Workspace/myblog/static/images/github-page.png]]

*** Summary
At this point, the entire workflow should be up and running. This very article was published using this process. To summarize, here are the key steps for writing a blog using =Emacs=:

Configure =ox-hugo= and organize your =org= files according to the documentation requirements.
Install and configure the =hugo= site locally, including the =theme=.
Configure =Github Pages= and set up a custom domain.
Configure the =Github= workflow to support automatic publishing after a =Git Push=.
After that, you can write entirely within =Emacs= and conveniently publish your text as online articles. Going forward, there is still room for optimization, including using =Org mode='s =Capture template= feature to quickly create posts, configuring different versions for Chinese and English, and adjusting styles, etc. I hope this article is helpful for friends with similar needs.
